# KEF_Project
This repository consists of a series of IoT projects with LoRA

# 1)  Weather Station 
      A weather station constructed using Industrial grade sensors. 
      The data is collected periodically and transmitted to a capture station using LoRa.
      After the data is received at the capture station using a gateway,it is uploaded to the cloud using a Nodemcu/Raspberry Pi
      
      The following sensor data were collected
      *****************************************
      
      i)    Humidity and Temperature
      ii)   Wind Speed
      iii)  Wind Direction
      iv)   Rain Gauge
      v)    Barometric Pressure
      vi)   Dew Point
      vii)  Air Density
      
      Components used
      ****************
      
      i)    Atmega328P
      ii)   Nodemcu/Raspberry Pi
      iii)  SMD Resistors,Capacitors
      iv)   Max485 TTL Converter Module
      v)    CD4053 triple 2-channel MUX/DEMUX
      vi)   RF Module E32-868T30D
      vii)  Weather Station Sensors (Detailed list provided in repo)
      
     
     
# 2) LIDAR WATER LEVEL MEASURING UNIT
      Measure Water level of a well using Lidar and transmit the data to a capture station via LoRa.
      The data is then uploaded to a Cloud Storage and made availble on Internet.
